Stereo original image
This file contains 400 pairs of kiwifruit binocular images (i.e. 800 images) taken from the Baiheng Organic Kiwifruit Orchard in Xianyang (108°09‘ E, 34°38’ N) and Kiwifruit Experimental Orchard of Northwest A&F University in Baoji (107°39’ E, 34°27’ N) for the 2023 kiwifruit harvest season. The corresponding 400 LiDAR data are also available, but are too large to upload, so please contact us if you need more information. In the images with rectangular annotations, kiwi and calyx were manually annotated as ‘kiwi’ and ‘calyx’. Please contact fulsh@nwafu.edu.cn, longsheng.fu@wsu.edu.
